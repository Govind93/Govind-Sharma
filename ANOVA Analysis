ANOVA is a statistical technique that is used for analyzing the differences in means in three or more independent groups. It compares the variance between-groups means to the variance within-groups. However, ANOVA is conducted using the same five step approach. 
ANOVA Hypotheses
•	Null hypothesis: Groups means are equal (no variation in means of groups)
H0: μ1=μ2=…=μp
•	Alternative hypothesis: At least, one group mean is different from other groups
H1: All μ are not equal
Null hypothesis is tested using the F-test for all groups.

Objectives:
1.	Perform analysis of variance by hand
2.	Interpret results of analysis of variance tests
3.	Identify the hypothesis testing procedure based on type of outcome variable and number of samples

The ANOVA technique:
 	Group 1	Group 2	Group 3	Group 4
Sample Size	n1	n2	n3	n4
Sample Mean	
Sample Standard Deviation	s1	s2	s3	s4

Test Statistics For ANOVA:
The decision rule for the F test in ANOVA is depends on the level of significance and the degrees of freedom. The F statistic has two degrees of freedom. Moreover, these are denoted df1 and df2 and called the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are defined as follows:
df1 = k-1 and df2=N-k
The critical value is found in a table of probability values for F distribution with degrees of freedom. Hence, the decision rule is: Reject H0 if Fcal > Ftab

Calculations:
Sample Dataset: There are four variables and each variable has 5 values.
p1	p2	p3	p4
89	93	89	81
89	92	88	78
88	94	89	81
78	89	93	92
78	88	90	82
We will run the ANOVA using the five-step approach.

Step 1. Compute the Summary Statistics.
Groups	Count	Sum	Average	Variance
p1	5	422	84.4	34.3
p2	5	456	91.2	6.7
p3	5	449	89.8	3.7
p4	5	414	82.8	28.7

Step 2. Calculate the group means and the overall mean.
group means	84.4	91.2	89.8	82.8
overall means	87.05	 	 	 

Step 3. Calculate SSR :  nΣ(Xj – X..)2 
 
Between Groups	
SSR	249.35	 
df (number of groups - 1)	3	
MS	83.11666667	 

Within Groups		
SSR	293.6	 
df (number of observations - number of groups)	16	
MS	18.35	 

Calculate SSE: Σ(Xij – Xj)2 
 	172.3125	112.9125	52.6125	205.1125
SSE	542.95	 	 	 
In order to find out the critical value of F we need degrees of freedom, df1=k-1 and df2=N-k.   

Step 4. Compute the test statistic.  
To fill the ANOVA table. In order to compute the sums of squares we must first compute the sample means for each group and the overall mean.  

Fill the ANOVA table						
Source of Variation	SS	df	MS	F	P-value	F crit
Between Groups	249.35	3	83.11667	4.529519	0.017567	3.238872
Within Groups	293.6	16	18.35	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Total	542.95	       19	 	 	 	 

Step 5. Conclusion
We reject H0 because 4.52 > 3.23. We have statistically significant evidence at α=0.05 to show that there is a difference in mean between the four groups. Hence, observed value of F is greater than the value in the F table value, then we can reject the null hypothesis with 95 percent confidence.
